## Traffic Simulator

This is a full featured simulation of a road of 5 km. 
* Overtake capable
* No incident or deterministic/randomized incident
* Different load distributions

At the end of the simulation, _SMD_, _California_ and _Minnesota_ incident detection algorithms are applied on the collected statistics.
